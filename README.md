# MyCodeCamp-API

My personal training to learn more about Web API in .NET Core. But instead, I am using .NET Core 2.0 here.

This project includes couple of approaches to implement certain feature.

I'm gonna convert [MyCodeCamp.Data](https://github.com/muhihsan/MyCodeCamp-API/tree/master/MyCodeCamps/MyCodeCamp.Data) to .NET Standard 2.0 later.

Please find below if you'd like to also learn more from the same course.<br />
